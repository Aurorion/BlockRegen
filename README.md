# BlockRegen
Updated version of BlockRegen.

As the original author of BlockRegen stepped down I've been developing the plugin further in my free time.
I don't have access to the spigot page and it most likely won't be updated, use [releases](https://github.com/Wertik/BlockRegen/releases) to get new versions of the plugin, all of them are posted on [discord](https://discord.gg/ZCxMca5).

## Supported versions

``1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16`` (as of 3.6.0)

### Notes

* Versions 1.8 (and any below) don't support boss bars for events.
* Versions below 1.12 have not been fully tested, report any issues.
* For materials on version 1.12 (and below) use their 1.13+ names.
  * ex.: Cyan dye -> ~~INK_SACK;4~~ CYAN_DYE
  * You can find a list of materials [here](https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/XMaterial.java).
