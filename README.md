# BlockRegen
Updated version of BlockRegen.

As the original author of BlockRegen stepped down I've been developing the plugin further in my free time.
I don't have access to the spigot page so use [this page](https://github.com/Wertik/BlockRegen/releases) to get new releases of the plugin, all of them are posted in the [discord](https://discord.gg/ZCxMca5).

**BlockRegen WorldGuard Flag**

If you're looking for something more basic and use WorldGuard, explore [BlockRegenFlag](https://github.com/Wertik/BlockRegenFlag) which adds a simple flag to regenerate blocks.
