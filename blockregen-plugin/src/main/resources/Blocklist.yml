  ##### Block chance example with simple block chaining #####

  # There's also a 50-50 chance it will turn into cobblestone, or bedrock.
  STONE:
    replace-block: COBBLESTONE:50;BEDROCK
    regenerate-into: EMERALD_ORE:20;STONE
    regen-delay: 3
    natural-break: false
  # Then if you mine the emerald ore, it gives you your reward, has a 50% chance to replace with STONE of COBBLE when regenerating.
  # Then it turns into emerald, or stone again.
  EMERALD_ORE:
    replace-block: STONE:50;COBBLESTONE
    regen-delay:
      low: 2
